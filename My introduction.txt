This is my First file on GitHub. A Poetry by Shilpi Johri of her favorite number 0:

Zero


Boundaries outside

And empty within

A deep dark whole

And a zero within



I hold no value

A loner within

Just simply a zero

Yes!  I am a zero within!



I roll down the heights

No ! Have no fright

For Nothing to lose 

As I am a zero within

 

Born in the Indian soil 

The fight of a zeroâ€™s uprise 

Valueless to infinity

Proudly! I am a zero within!



I am unique and WHOLE

A mirror for negativity within

To reflect the positivity therein

Soulfully yours! I am a zero within!

                       -Shilpi Johri
